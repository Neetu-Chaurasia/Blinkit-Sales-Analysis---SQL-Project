# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis---SQL-Project
# 📊 SQL Project – Blinkit Sales Analysis 🛒
- In this project, I analyzed sales data from Blinkit to uncover key e-commerce performance insights using structured SQL queries. 🔍 What I Did:
- Collected and organized sales data into a relational schema with PRIMARY and FOREIGN keys
- Imported and managed data on orders, products, customers, and ratings
- Used SQL Joins, Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, NTILE), CASE, and advanced Aggregations
- Performed category-wise, product-wise, and customer-wise performance analysis
- Calculated total sales, average order values, and revenue contributions
- Identified top products, high-value customers, and delivery performance metrics
- Labeled orders as “Fast Delivery” or “Slow” based on delivery time
🛠 Tools & Skills Used: MySQL, Data Cleaning, SQL Joins, Window Functions, Aggregations, Grouping, Subqueries, E-commerce Data Analysis
- This project strengthened my SQL and analytical skills by applying them to a real-world sales scenario, showing how data can guide business growth and customer engagement strategies.
